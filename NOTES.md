Core gameplay loop:

1. Start level
2. Goal: Get X number of points to advance to next level
3. Points are obtained by picking up items spawned in the level, which draws the player to different areas of the map
4. The difficulty scales as the player gets closer to the goal, as well as scaling based on what number level it is
5. Instead of just advancing to the next level once you max out, do something super cool and awesome(?)
6. Instead of representing points as numbers, use a bar that fills up for the *current* points needed

Fuel idea: display as a "checklist" e.g. [X] [ ] [ ]
If you miss a fuel pickup, it's a game over
When you pick up all of the fuel, return to a rocket ship object to continue to next level

Between levels, show some kind of rocket animation, ending in a crash?
